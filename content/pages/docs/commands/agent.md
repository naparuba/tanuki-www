# XXX Agent

The `XXX agent` command is the heart of XXX: it runs the agent that
performs the important task of maintaining membership information,
running checks, announcing services, handling queries, etc.

Due to the power and flexibility of this command, the XXX agent
is documented in its own section. See the [XXX Agent](/docs/agent/basics.html)
section for more information on how to use this command and the
options it has.
