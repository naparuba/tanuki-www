# XXX vs. Custom Solutions

As a code base grows, a monolithic app usually evolves into a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). And in such architecture manage service discovery and configuration leads to organizations building home grown solutions.

It is an undisputed fact that distributed systems are hard; building one is error prone and time consuming.
Most systems simplify the problem by introducing single points of failure such
as a single Redis or RDBMS to maintain cluster state. These solutions may work in the short term,
but they are rarely fault tolerant or scalable. Besides these limitations,
they require time and resources to build and maintain.

XXX provides the core set of features needed by a SOA out of the box. By using XXX,
organizations can leverage open source work to reduce their time and resource commitment to
re-inventing the wheel and focus on their business applications.

XXX is built on well-cited research, and is designed with the constraints of
distributed systems in mind. At every step, XXX takes efforts to provide a robust
and scalable solution for organizations of any size.
